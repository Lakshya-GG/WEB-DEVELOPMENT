### Creating a complex component that will render 3 food item images, name of food, price and a form input to take the quantity from the user. 
- When the quantity of the item is entered the total cost of the order summary needs to be calculated and displayed at the bottom along with the Order time and expected delivery time.
- Added styling using CSS modules in which all class names are scoped locally by default.
- The food item details are read from an array of objects.
